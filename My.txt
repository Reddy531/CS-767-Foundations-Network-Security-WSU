Steps followed in order to perform the tasks are:

Installing fail2ban i.e. using command " sudo apt-get update" and later perform "sudo apt-get upgrade"
Now, install fail2ban using command "sudo apt-get install -y fail2ban"
Now, we need to enable and start fail2ban using commands "sudo systemctl enable fail2ban" and "sudo systemctl start fail2ban"
Hence, we can see that fail2ban blocks the brute force traffic
Steps Followed in order to Install Modsecurity and enable for apache2

Perform "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt upgrade"
Now, install ModSecurity on Apache using command "sudo apt install libapache2-mod-security2"
Restart the apache server using the command " sudo systemctl restart apache2"
Now, configure the ModSecurity using the command "sudo cp /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf"
Now, again restart the apache server using the command "sudo systemctl restart apache2"
Steps Followed to make Modsecurity rules active

We know that we have "owasp-modsecurity-crs-3.2-dev" folder
open the folder using the command "cd owasp-modsecurity-crs-3.2-dev"
Now, Move the crs-setup file using the command "sudo mv crs-setup.conf.example /etc/modsecurity/crs-setup.conf"
Then move the rules/ directory using the command "sudo mv rules/ /etc/modsecurity"
Next, check your security2.conf file to verify it’s set to load the ModSecurity rules using command "sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security2.conf"
Now, Verify you have the following lines included and uncommented i.e. "IncludeOptional /etc/modsecurity/*.conf" and " Include /etc/modsecurity/rules/*.conf"
Restart the Apache server using the command " sudo systemctl restart apache2"
